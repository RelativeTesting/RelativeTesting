To use it in the Z3 library, I need to define a variable as follows for each variable.
The Types statement specifies the type, such as int, str, float.
The concrete expression is used to define predefined values, such as y equals 8.
The symbolic expression allows each variable to be defined symbolically according to constraints.
If I want to make more than one definition, I must write an "and" or "or" between them in inside of string
such as "@(param1 > 15) and (param1 < 30)" , "@(param1 == 15) or (param1 == 5)"
On the other hand you must not combine expression such as "@(100 < param1 < 200). You must be write seperately such as
"@param1 >= 100 and param1 <= 200"
Also,if a variable is not concretely defined, do not give  the concrete constraint expression
You can see a one example code that fits these definitions below:
@types(x="int", y="int")
@symbolic(param1 = "@(param1 > 15) and (param1 < 30)", param2 = "@(param2 != 0) or (param2 != 15)")
@concrete(y=8)
Now I will share a code with you below:
